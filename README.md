# Public Api [![Build Status](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/public-api/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/public-api/actions)

## Goal

> Provide a common api across all registries.

## Quick contributing guide

* Fork and clone locally.
* Build the solution with Visual Studio, `build.cmd` or `build.sh`.
* Create a topic specific branch in git. Add a nice feature in the code. Do not forget to add tests and/or docs.
* Run `build.cmd` or `build.sh` to make sure everything still compiles and all tests are still passing.
* When built, you'll find the binaries in `./dist` which you can then test with locally, to ensure the bug or feature has been successfully implemented.
* Send a Pull Request.

## Development

### Getting started

TODO: More to come :)

### Possible build targets

Our `build.sh` script knows a few tricks. By default it runs with the `Test` target.

The buildserver passes in `BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER` as an integer to version the results and `BUILD_DOCKER_REGISTRY` to point to a Docker registry to push the resulting Docker images.

#### NpmInstall

Run an `npm install` to setup Commitizen and Semantic Release.

#### DotNetCli

Checks if the requested .NET Core SDK and runtime version defined in `global.json` are available.
We are pedantic about these being the exact versions to have identical builds everywhere.

#### Clean

Make sure we have a clean build directory to start with.

#### Restore

Restore dependencies for `debian.8-x64` and `win10-x64` using dotnet restore and Paket.

#### Build

Builds the solution in Release mode with the .NET Core SDK and runtime specified in `global.json`
It builds it platform-neutral, `debian.8-x64` and `win10-x64` version.

#### Test

Runs `dotnet test` against the test projects.

#### Publish

Runs a `dotnet publish` for the `debian.8-x64` and `win10-x64` version as a self-contained application.
It does this using the Release configuration.

#### Pack

Packs the solution using Paket in Release mode and places the result in the `dist` folder.
This is usually used to build documentation NuGet packages.

#### Containerize

Executes a `docker build` to package the application as a docker image. It does not use a Docker cache.
The result is tagged as latest and with the current version number.

#### DockerLogin

Executes `ci-docker-login.sh`, which does an aws ecr login to login to Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
This uses the local aws settings, make sure they are working!

#### Push

Executes `docker push` to push the built images to the registry.
